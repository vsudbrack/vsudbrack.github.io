title: Genetic architecture underlying disruptive selection
question: How different ecological processes favour the evolution of different trait genetic architectures?
description:  How different ecological processes favour the evolution of different trait genetic architectures?

In subdivided populations, different ecological processes drive intraspecific phenotypic variation at different spatial scales. While spatial heterogeneity promote distinct morphs in different patches leading to local adaptation, negative-frequency dependent selection arising from local competition favours polymorphism within patches. The emergence and maintenance of these different phenotypes is not straightforward when traits are polygenic as hybridization breaks up adaptive allele combinations. In this case, selection acts on genetic architecture to concentrate allelic effects onto as few independently segregating loci as possible. This concentration may be achieved via different genetic mechanisms such as amplifiers of allele effect size or suppressors of recombination, but it remains unclear whether selection favours different mechanisms in different ecological settings. 

In this project, together with my PhD supervisor Charles Mullon and the postdoc at our lab Ewan O. Flintham, we use computational models to study the evolution of a traitâ€™s genetic architecture through various modifiers of allelic effects and of recombination, varying the extent to which polymorphism in the trait is favoured by spatial heterogeneity or local competition. We show that owing to more frequent hybridisation, local competition exerts stronger selection on genetic architecture than spatial heterogeneity. Furthermore, these different ecological processes favour different levels of genetic dominance and different patterns of recombination. In particular, local adaptation often involves large regions of recombination suppression when local competition generally sees multiple smaller regions scattered across the genome.
