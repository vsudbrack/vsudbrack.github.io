title: Genetic structural variation in populations
question: How selfers accumulate satellite DNA in their genome?

I am investigating the effects of non-random mating on the polymorphism of tandem repeat sequences. Tandem repeats are a significant source of genetic structural variation within populations. In this research, I am exploring how various processes during gametic production, such as slippage replication and unequal crossover, as well as selection and genetic drift, influence the distribution of tandem repeat copies in populations that undergo partial selfing.
