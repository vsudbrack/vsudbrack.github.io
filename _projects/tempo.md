title: Rate of adaptation in subdivided populations
description: How fast adaptive alleles sweep under dispersal limitation?
question:  How fast can subdivided populations adapt?
---

In this project, we use mathematical models and computer simulations to study the population genetics of subdivided populations. We are especially interested in the time that new mutations or alleles from the standing genetic variation take to fix via selective sweeps. The goal is to better understand how dispersal, life cycle, genetic dominance, and population structure interact and influence the pace of adaptation and the molecular signature of such adaptation.
