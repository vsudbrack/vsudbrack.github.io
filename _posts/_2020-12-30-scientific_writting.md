I've been recently focoused on writing my Master thesis and that was a moment of great insights on how to write (nothing more inspiring than deadlines, right?)

Writing can be very challenging, specially for non-native English speakers. 

This is **my** personal experience and it can be perfectly normal if it doesn't work for you - but you can give it a try!

#### Getting confortable with $\latex$

Use a manuscript template, such as . 

[Detexify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)
[Latex TableGenerator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/)

```tex
%% Commands to make writing easier
\newcommand{\etal}{\textit{et al.}}
\newcommand{\mean}[1]{\left\langle #1\right\rangle}
\newcommand{\gaussian}[2]{\mathcal{N}\left(\mu = #1, \sigma = #2\right)}
```


```tex
\usepackage[table,xcdraw,dvipsnames]{xcolor}
%% Commands to make commeting easier
\newcommand{\VS}[1]{\textcolor{Red}{(Vitor: #1)}} 
```
Other colors to you use with your coauthors that are also easy to read: Red, Green, Blue, BurntOrange,Purple,...


#### Ordering

Models and methods $\to$ Results $\to$ Abstract (Poster/Presentation) $\to$ Introduction $\leftrightarrow$ Discussion


The idea of writting an Abstract (or making a Poster or Presentation of your results so far) is having a broad perpective of your results and, specially, knowning the highlights of your work. Making a presentation is also a great opportunity to think about figures, graphics or diagrams that helps the read to understand your results. 

While you are reviewing the literature, you can take notes and summarize the main point of articles in one or a few paragraphs. Afterwords, you can more this paragraphs across the introduction and discussion as guidelines to put your work in perspective. 

#### Divide to conquer


#### Play with words

**Genderfree speech** 
This task is fairly easy to do in English compared to other gender-oriented languages, but yet I believe to be fundamental. 

Exemples: mankind $\to$ humankind, his $\to$ one's/someone's/..., 

**Synonyms and Antonyms**
[Thesaurus](https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/hi)

This is also useful to break sequences of repeated sentance structures. 

**Adverbs** 
Use them always it is necessary, avoid them always it is possible. 


#### CTRL+F

**The** is commonly overemployed by non-native English speakers, specially Portuguese ones. Make sure revisited your text and tried to remove them from your final version. Remember we use 'the' before specific things, so usually words in plural or abstract words in sigular wont have them.  

**Exemples:** "We found that the effects are typically positive" $\to$ "We found that effects are typically positive"

**That** is also commonly overemployed,

**Exemples:** "We found that effects are typically positive" $\to$ "We found typically positive effects"

**Where** is frequently employed to refer to Equations. 

**Exemples:** "When considered Eq.(1), where $K$ is the carrying capacity,..." $\to$ "When considered Eq.(1), in which $K$ is the carrying capacity,..."

**Inconsistent use of terms**, specially hyphenation, acronames and capital letters. 

**Exemples:** "Neighbor" $\leftrightarrow$ "Neighbour", "Fragmentation degree" $\leftrightarrow$ "Degree of fragmentation" 
This last one is an example where you can use 'of' to break long chains of nouns. 

#### Grammar

Pay attention to the use of present and past tenses. Use past tenses to what you did and discovred and present tenses to what is generally true. 
When writting proposals, replace sentences as 'We want to simulate...' to more proactive sentences, as 'We will simulate...'.

**Active and passive voices** are both important, try to interplay with both of them up in the text. Sometimes it is easier to employ passive voice, but it makes the text less atractive, interesting and alive.  

**Conditionals**
If ... Present + Present
If ... Present + Simple Future
If ... Simples Past + Conditional Future
If ... Past Pefect + 'would have'

The last three require comma in this particular order, but they don't require comma if you change the order.
