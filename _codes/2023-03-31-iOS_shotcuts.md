Apple's **iOS Shortcuts** is a powerful automation tool designed for iPhone and iPad users, allowing them to streamline their daily tasks and routines. With Shortcuts, users can **create custom actions** that combine multiple steps, such as opening specific apps, sending messages, or setting reminders, and execute them with a single tap. This innovative feature has become increasingly popular among iOS users who want to boost their productivity and save time on repetitive tasks.


For us scientisits, some of the tasks which we perform daily can be achieved on a click using this tool. A lot of my **reading** and **searching** have been done recently on either iPad or Mac, and thus I have developed a few Shortcuts to help me. As I believe they can also be helpful to other scientists, I am sharing them on this post.

On the links below, you can download these Shortcuts and install them in your iOS. You can find these personalized Shortcuts in the "Share" option after selection a piece of text (check the example below).

## GoogleScholar Search

When working with research papers or web pages on your device, you may come across a particular term, phrase, or author's name that you want to **search for on Google Scholar**. With the use of Shortcuts, you can quickly select the relevant text and trigger a custom shortcut that will open Google Scholar and automatically search for that specific term or author. This feature can save you time and effort, as you don't have to manually copy and paste the text into the search bar. Additionally, this functionality is not limited to single words; you can also select an **entire phrase** or the **title of a paper** to search for relevant scholarly articles quickly and easily.

## Get on SciHub

If you've ever come across a paywall when trying to access a scientific paper, you know how frustrating it can be. Fortunately, with the help of Shortcuts, you can easily bypass this obstacle. Simply select the DOI link of the paper you're interested in, and use a custom shortcut to **search for it on Sci-Hub**, a website that provides free access to millions of research papers. By using this shortcut, you can quickly and easily access the paper you need, without having to go through the paywall.

## Search Synonyms

Are you stuck on a particular word and can't think of any synonyms? With the help of Shortcuts, you can find alternative words that can help convey the same meaning. Simply select the word in question, and use a custom shortcut to **search for a list of synonyms** on Thesaurus.
