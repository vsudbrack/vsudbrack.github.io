# Hello,

**I'm Vítor Sudbrack**, Brazilian scientist, pursuing a Physics Master program at the *Institute of Theoretical Physics (IFT - Unesp)* in São Paulo - SP, Brazil; and currently working at the *Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (IFISC - UiB)* Palma de Mallorca, Spain, to get a *sandwich degree*.

My career ~~overdrinking coffee~~ in Physics started in 2014, but back then I was just learning calculus. In 2019, I was laureated **Bachelor in Physics with honors** by the *Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)* in Porto Alegre - RS.

My regular work is done at IFT under the supervision of professors *Roberto A. Kraenkel* and *Renato M. Coutinho*. Together, we numerically study **population dynamics in highly fragmented landscapes**. We aim to understand the effects of fragmentation and habitat spatial features into species and ecological systems. You can read much more about it [here](/projects/frag.html). 

During pandemic times, we joined an [Observatory](https://covid19br.github.io) - a collection of scientists from very complementary backgrounds - aiming to **understand and analyze the data from COVID-19 in Brazil**. You can imagine what a hard task that is...	

I have already researched at the *[Fluid Lab - IMPA](http://fluid.impa.br/Home)* with professor *Alexei Mailybaev* in Rio de Janeiro, RJ. There, we studied fully developed bidimensional turbulence in the case of *Kelvin-Helmholtz instability*. And I worked as well at the *Laboratory for Cellular Structure (LabCel - UFRGS)*, both during my undergraduate years. Since then, I am working with mathematical biology, **uncracking the puzzles of life**!

I am mostly **interested** in (macroscopic) *mathematical biology*, for instance modeling **population dynamics, ecological and evolution processes, and complex systems**. Also, I enjoy some mathematical ~~monsters~~ puzzles such as nonlinear differential equations and graph theory. I love giving seminars and telling people about my research and other interesting things, specially for outreach purposes. Hence, invitations are always welcome!

I like to think **I create universes on a computer screen...**, but 95% percent of the job is pogramming and looking at data on this same computer screen *hahah*

Studying and researching allowed me knowing **many nice people, many interesting places and many awesome wonders** of this universe. I share for science the same feeling *Lise Meitner* described to physics in this quote below.

It is a kind of personal love, as one has for a person to whom one is grateful for many things." %}
