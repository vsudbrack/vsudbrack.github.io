## Hello,

**I'm Vitor Sudbrack**, Brazilian modeller. I'm currently a PhD student at the *[University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home.html)*, working at the **[Theoretical Evolutionary Ecology lab](https://lab-mullon.github.io/)**  with *Charles Mullon*. 

I work on the dynamics of trait variation within structured populations, and how this variation is stored across multiple biological scales, from individuals to subpopulations, populations, and ultimately, species.

### My scientific interests

I am very question-driven, modelling relevant problems in evolutionary biology. For instance, models of **population dynamics, population genetics and complex systems** have been the subject of my work. Often I employ a **diffusion approach** to work on these problems. When it comes to simulations, I like to think **I create universes on a computer screen...**, but 95% percent of the job is pogramming and looking at data on this same computer screen. 

Studying and researching has introduced me to **many nice people, many interesting places, and many awesome problems** of this universe, and I am grateful for this.

### My studies

I have a Master degree in Theoretical Physics (2021) by the *[Institute of Theoretical Physics](https://www.ift.unesp.br/#!/en)* (*IFT - Unesp*) in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, with a sandwich period at the *[Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems](https://www.ifisc.uib-csic.es/en/)* (*IFISC - UiB*) in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. In my Master thesis, I studied *population dynamics in highly fragmented landscapes*. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I joined an [Observatory](https://covid19br.github.io) - a collection of scientists from very complementary backgrounds aiming to **understand and analyze the data from COVID-19 in Brazil**. We performed nowcasting and developed modelings. 


Before that, I was laureated *Bachelor in Physics with honors* (2019) by the Institute of Physics of the *Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)* in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. During my undergraduate years, I have researched at the *[Fluid Lab - IMPA](http://fluid.impa.br/Home)* with professor *Alexei Mailybaev* in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. There, we studied fully developed bidimensional turbulence in the case of *Kelvin-Helmholtz instability*. And I worked as well at the *Laboratory for Cellular Structure (LabCel - UFRGS)*, where I described the statistical time evolution of a mathematical model for protein interaction using graphs. 


### Off-science me: accordion, coffee & orchids

Aside from science, I'm really enjoying playing the accordion and reading about music theory lately. I find the symmetries of the button accordion perfect to connect to theory. I'm also a huge barista wannabe! I am always eager to learn new things about coffee and practice my skills with V60 extraction, French press, and expressos. I've recently developed a fascination in orchids, and I now have tens of different species at home.
