Here, I wrote about a few of these mathematical lensings I've already worked on.

## Graph Theory Applied to Biology

**Networks** (or graphs) are mathematical tools we use to model real problems (in biology, sociology, geography, economy,...) and study them systematically. In particular, it is possible to study *expanding networks*, given a node addition rule. We studied numerically the growth of some of these networks based on averages of random initializations and analytically, through a **master equation formulation** applied to these addition rules, accounting for all possible scenarios that may probabilistically happen within the model. 

The importance of this work is predicting the future behaviour of the real systems described by the studied networks and understanding and quantifying the parameters related to this modeling. Here, we consider **Divergence and Duplication** networks, which mimic properties of *Protein-Protein Interaction Networks (PPI)* - i.e., given **mutation parameters**, the characteristic features of these graphs are similar to those found on experimental networks of related proteins. 

The results of this project were published on this article below. You can also check slides with a synthesis of the main results: determining parameter ranges for which networks reach a steady state and evaluating the time-dependent and asympthotic network degree distribution.

## Magnetoreception in Multicellular Magnetotactic Prokaryotes

**Magnetosensibility** is the ability of organisms to respond to the presence of a magnetic field, changing their behavior. This can be achieved actively through **magnetoreception**, when organisms detect the geomagnetic field and use this vector information in their spatial orientation, or passively, as in **magnetotaxia**, when just like a needle, organisms behave as magnetic dipoles and align themselves with the lines of the Earth's magnetic field. These kinds of responses have been observed, for instance, in dogs, ants, several birds and bees.

In order to further understand this kind of behaviour in a **Multicellular Magnetotactic Prokaryotes (MMP)** collected in brazilian lake, we designed this experimental work aiming to study the **kinetic description** of a particular type of movement (*ping-pong motion*) in MMPs as the intensity of the magnetic field varies, as well as its probability of occurrence. Our main conclusion was that this type of motility has several characteristics that depend on the magnetic field intensity and, therefeore, it is best explained by *magnetoreceptive mechanisms*.

This work happened during the [4th Advanced School of Experimental Physics (**4th EAFExp**)](https://mesonpi.cat.cbpf.br/eafexp2019/) organized
by **[Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas (CBPF)](http://www.cbpf.br/)** in February 2019, supervised by professors **[Daniel Acosta-Avalos](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=CZk6iHkAAAAJ)** and Henrique Lins de Barros, and done together with some amazing researchers I had the chance to meet thorugh this project: Ana Gabriela, Henrique, Karen, Katterine and Lis.
