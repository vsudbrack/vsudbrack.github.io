## Graph Theory Applied to Biology

Networks (or graphs) are mathematical tools we use to model real problems (in biology, sociology, geography, economy,...) and study them systematically. In particular, it is possible to study expanding networks, given a node addition rule. We studied numerically the growth of some of these networks based on averages of random initializations and analytically, through master equation formulation applied to these systems, accounting for all possible scenarios that may probabilistically happen within the model.

The importance of this work is predicting the future behaviour of the real systems described by the studied networks and understanding and quantifying the parameters related to this modeling.

This work is a collaboration with professors Leonardo G. Brunnet, Rita M. C. de Almeida, Ricardo M. Ferreira and Daniel Gamermann within LabCel group at the Physics Institute at UFRGS. It was funded by federal government (CNPq).
